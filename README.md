# Forecast-Audit

Forecast-Audit is an OpenEnv-compatible benchmark environment for forecast and time-series quality auditing.

The agent acts like a data/forecast analyst and must:
- identify data quality issues
- repair missing or corrupted values
- respect business/operational constraints
- return structured actions with clear rationale

## What This Project Uses

- Python 3.11+
- FastAPI + Uvicorn for HTTP API serving
- Pydantic for request/response/state models
- OpenEnv spec (`openenv.yaml`) for environment packaging and validation
- Docker for containerized local and deployment runs
- Validation and inference scripts for local checks and baseline runs

## What This Project Does

- Provides task episodes through `POST /reset`
- Accepts agent decisions through `POST /step`
- Tracks environment state through `GET /state`
- Returns reward breakdowns to score action quality
- Supports easy, medium, and hard task difficulty paths
- Exposes a health endpoint for deployment checks

## Installation

See the dedicated setup pages:

- [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md)
- [docs/quick-start.md](docs/quick-start.md)
- [docs/environment-variables.md](docs/environment-variables.md)

## Run Locally

Use [docs/local.md](docs/local.md) for full local run steps.

## Docker

Use [docs/docker.md](docs/docker.md) for Docker build and run steps.

## API Endpoints

- `POST /reset` -> starts a task episode
- `POST /step` -> submits one action
- `GET /state` -> returns current environment state
- `GET /health` -> health check

## Round 1 Quick Checks

Use [docs/round1/submission-guide.md](docs/round1/submission-guide.md) for Round 1 validation and submission checks.
